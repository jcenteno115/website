<p> I have seen anime before, but wasn't drawn towards and so maybe only saw mainstream anime like Dragon Ball Z. I think I got into 
  anime in the summer of my junior year of high school. My parents got rid of our cable and was only left with Netflix, but I'll leave 
  my talk there. If you want to know more about anime just click the link below.
