<h1>HELLO THERE</h1>
  <p> This page was created just for random things, fun facts, and other stuff that I find interesting.</p
  
  <div class="sign">
  <svg width="400" height="100">
  <rect width="400" height="100" style="fill:rgb(0,0,0);stroke-width:10;stroke:rgb(0,0,0)" />
    <text fill="#ffffff" font-size="45"  font-family="Verdana" x="110" y="68">ANIME</text>
</svg>
  </div>
  <!--Javier, "To create the shape use the <rect> command and to add properties insert them between the <> signs. Then to create
   the text add just look at the code underneath it because it's straight forward; the only thing to pay attention to is the x and y
   which is the postiion of the text in the rectangle.-->
  
<p> I have seen anime before, but wasn't drawn towards and so maybe only saw mainstream anime like Dragon Ball Z. I think I got into 
  anime in the summer of my junior year of high school. My parents got rid of our cable and was only left with Netflix, but I'll leave 
  my talk there. If you want to know more about anime just click the link below.
  
  <div class="video">
 <video width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="Game3.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
  </div>
 <!--Javier, "To insert a video into html you have to make sure to upload the file into whatever web-based hosting service
    you are using. Then just use the code above to embed the video into the webpage. The <div> is use to divide the sections of the
    page, that way you can alter it and add CSS without affecting the rest of the page."-->
