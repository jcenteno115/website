    <h1>Usability and Accessibility for this Website</h1>
    <p>I tried to make this website as accessible as possible to people who visit it. I tried to make it as simple as I could, that way
       age and computer knowledge doesn't affect the person's enjoyment of the website. I don't have too much experience with
      creating websites, but this was intended to work in all browsers.</p> 
    
    <h2>Visuals</h2>
    <p> For the images and the video in the website I tried to make them large, but not ot he extent that they take up the entire screen
      and felt that the sizes were reasonable. I also created alt text for every image that way people who are visually impaired will
      be able to tell what is on the screen.</p> 
      
    <h2>Navigation</h2>
    <p> I really wanted navigation to be as simple as possible that way nobody can lost too easily. I decided to put the navigation bar at
      the very top of the homepage so people will instantly see it and the links. I designed it so whenever the person hovers over 
      the link it will turn a different color to let them know which links they are about click. To let them know which page they
      recently visited the underline disappers.</p> 
      
    <h2>Printing</h2>
    <p> I made so that printing would be easy, by that having everything in random locations. I made the alignments as simple as I could
      get them. To make sure the printing was good I previewed the page and everything was in order.</p> 
    
    <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
    <p> The website will be going through several reworks in the near future to make things more appealing and possibly easier navigation,
      so if there's any constructive please contact me.
