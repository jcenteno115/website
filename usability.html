    <h1>Usability and Accessibility for this Website</h1>
    <p>I tried to make this website as accessibile as possible to people who visit it. I tried to make it as simple as I could, that way
      <br /> age and computer knowledge doesn't affect the person's enjoyment of the website. I don't have too much experience with
      <br />creating webites, but this was intended to work in all browsers. 
    
    <h2>Visuals</h2>
    <p> For the images and the video in the website I tried to make them large, but not ot he extent that they take up the entire screen
      <br /> and felt that the sizes were reasonable. I also created alt text for every image that way people who are visually impared will
      <br /> be able to tell what is on the screen.
      
    <h2>Navigation</h2>
    <p> I really wanted navigation to be as simple as possible that way nobody can lost too easily. I decided to put the navigation bar at
      <br />the very top of the homepage so people will instantly see it and the links. I designed it so whenever the person hovers over 
      <br /> the link it will turn a different color to let them know which links they are about click. To let them know which page they
      <br /> recently visited the underline  disappers.
    <h2>Links</h2>
    
    <h2>Printing</h2>
