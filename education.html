  <h1>Post-Secondary Education</h1>
  <p> After graduating high school I attended Florida Gulf Coast University, in hopes of getting a Civil Engineering degree. The first
    year was just about completing my general courses, however things were different in the first Fall semseter of my second year.
    I was struggling to understand the material and decided that this was for me.
