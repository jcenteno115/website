    created to change the icon in the tab. First you have state their relationship using rel, then what type of file or format it is
    and then you have to insert their location with href, for anything not in the internet uploade the file to web-hosting 
    server and for CSS make sure where in the server it is located."-->

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p> Hello there, this is my website and here you will find different facts about myself. This may be of use if you are looking for 
    hiring,since my résumé will be available, as well as my some of my projects and experiences of my previous work. I am also using
    as way to stay on track of several things, so you don't really have to worry about those areas.</p>
  <h2>My Current Status</h2>
  <p>I am currently a 19-year-old at Florida Gulf Coast University and I am studying to get a major in mathematics and a minor in 
    education. I am in the second semester of my second year and I am currently taking five classes. My grades are stable and I have a 
    current GPA of 3.27. I am not in any organization as of now due to my schedule no giving too much freedom, not to mention that I 
    commute to school and that constrains things a bit more. Moving on, my classes this semester aren't too difficult, but I won't say 
    that they're easy either.</p>

  <!--Javier,"To create a this gradient you"ll have to create a canvas and assign it an id="" and inside create the dimensions that you
   want it to have. After than add the script, assign the id to a varaible to make things easier. Assign another variable but for the
   text part the canvas. After that add the differnt colors of the gradient that you want and assign them where to be in the text. 
   Set the text fill style to gradient and then enter your message and the x,y positions, end the script."-->
