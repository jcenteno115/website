  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p> Hello there, this is my website, here you will find different facts about myself. This may be of use if you are looking for hiring, 
   since my résumé will lbe avaiable, as well as my some of my <br />projects and experiences of my previous work. I am also using as way to stay
  keep track of several things, so you don't really have to worry about those areas.</p>
  <h2>My Current Status</h2>
  <p> I am currently a 19 year old at Florida Gulf Coast University and I am studying to get a major in mathematics and a minor education.
  I am in the second second semester of my second year<br /> and I am currently taking five classes. My grades are stable and I have a 
  current GPA of 3.27. I not in any organization as of now due to my schedule no giving too much freedom, not<br /> to mention that I commute to
  school and that constrains things a bit more. Moving on, my classes this semseter aren't too diffcult, but I won't say that they're easy, either.</p>
